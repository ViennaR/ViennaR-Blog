<h2>R in corporate enivroments (finance depts.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walterdjuric/"><strong>Walter Djuric</strong></a></p>
<p>Walter did a short presentation, on the potential and real life uses of R (and RStudio) in a typical business (ie Accounting) departmentn in a large Austrian financial institution.<br />
He discussed common pitfalls (mostly linked to infrastructure problems eg firewalls, non-admin user-rights, AV software, etc) and what tactics can be applied to cope with these challenges (eg a local CRAN, package building for the team, enhanced .Rprofiles, etc).</p>
