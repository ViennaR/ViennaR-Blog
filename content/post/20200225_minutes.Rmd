For the first 2020 meetup we gathered in late February, just days before R's official 20 year birthday.      
The great location this time was [IBM Austria's headoffice](https://www.ibm.com/at-de) in the heart of Vienna and drinks and snacks were generously provided by the hosts.         

      
### TALK ONE (twice Thomas and Rudolf)       
The first presentation was held by IBM's own (and [ViennaR meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/) member) [Thomas [Strehl]](https://at.linkedin.com/in/strehl-thomas-122867110), [Thomas [Weinrich]](https://www.xing.com/profile/Thomas_Weinrich3) and [Rudolf [Pailer]](https://at.linkedin.com/in/rudolfpailer).      
The talk focused on application of the CRISP-DM approach for putting ML models (CRSIPML) in R into production.   The slides, which include an introduction to CRISPML via a real life business case can be found [here]((/slides/REnterprise-Deck_20200227.pdf)).      
You can also check out the recording of their talk [here on YouTube]().  

### TALK TWO (Mario)
The second speaker was ([Quantargo's](https://www.quantargo.com) and [ViennaR meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/) Co-Organizer) [Mario [Annau]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-annau-a68b2056/).     
Mario introduced us to a different approach towards R in production.    
Where the colleagues form IBM focused on the classic (CI/CD) build pipeline and tools, Mario was showing RStudio PRO's solutions, which basically cover the deployment process via one push button functionality.     
He finieshed his round with a gentle intriduction to Lambda R functions (so called ['Quibits'](https://www.quantargo.com/qbits)) as 'light weight' means of making R functions 'publicly' available in production.    You can find a webcast recording of Marios topics [here](www.some-address.at)    
      
Thanks again everyone for attending and IBM for being such great hosts.     Hope to see you all again soon eg in March.
