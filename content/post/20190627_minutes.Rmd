## R in corporate enivroments (finance depts.) 
[**Walter Djuric**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walterdjuric/)

Walter did a short presentation, on the potential and real life uses of R (and RStudio) in a typical business (ie Accounting) departmentn in a large Austrian financial institution.     
He discussed common pitfalls (mostly linked to infrastructure problems eg firewalls, non-admin user-rights, AV software, etc) and what tactics can be applied to cope with these challenges (eg a local CRAN, package building for the team, enhanced .Rprofiles, etc).   

You can find the **html slides/pages** of his presentation [here](/slides/VR-2019-06-27_WDpres.html).
