<p>For the first 2020 meetup we gathered in late February, just days before R’s official 20 year birthday.<br />
The great location this time was <a href="https://www.ibm.com/at-de">IBM Austria’s headoffice</a> in the heart of Vienna and drinks and snacks were generously provided by the hosts.</p>

<h3>TALK ONE (twice Thomas and Rudolf)</h3>
<p>The first presentation was held by IBM’s own (and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/">ViennaR meetup</a> member) <a href="https://at.linkedin.com/in/strehl-thomas-122867110">Thomas [Strehl]</a>, <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Thomas_Weinrich3">Thomas [Weinrich]</a> and <a href="https://at.linkedin.com/in/rudolfpailer">Rudolf [Pailer]</a>.<br />
The talk focused on application of the CRISP-DM approach for putting ML models (CRSIPML) in R into production. The slides, which include an introduction to CRISPML via a real life business case can be found <a href="/slides/REnterprise-Deck_20200227.pdf">here</a>.<br />
You can also check out the recording of their talk</p>

<h3>TALK TWO (Mario)</h3>
<p>The second speaker was (<a href="https://www.quantargo.com">Quantargo’s</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/">ViennaR meetup</a> Co-Organizer) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-annau-a68b2056/">Mario [Annau]</a>.<br />
Mario introduced us to a different approach towards R in production.<br />
Where the colleagues form IBM focused on the classic (CI/CD) build pipeline and tools, Mario was showing RStudio PRO’s solutions, which basically cover the deployment process via one push button functionality.<br />
He finished his round with a gentle introduction to Lambda R functions (so called <a href="https://www.quantargo.com/qbits">‘QBits’</a>) to deploy R functions based on serverless technologies within seconds.</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone for attending and IBM for being such great hosts. Hope to see you all again soon at our next Meetup in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/events/269180461">March</a>.</p>
